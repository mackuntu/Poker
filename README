# Poker - Texas Hold'em Implementation

## Purpose
This repository contains a Java implementation of Texas Hold'em poker. The project simulates a poker game with multiple players, a dealer, and hand evaluations. It includes various classes to manage the game logic, player actions, card handling, and hand ranking.

## Current Status
The project is currently functional with the following features:
- Card and deck management
- Player actions (fold, raise, call, check)
- Hand evaluation and ranking
- Basic game flow (deal, flop, turn, river, and showdown)
- Unit tests for deck and hand evaluation

## Remaining Work
- Improve the user interface for better interaction and visualization
- Add more comprehensive unit tests for all game scenarios
- Implement betting rounds and pot management
- Enhance the AI for player actions and decision-making
- Optimize the code for better performance and readability
- Add documentation and comments for better code understanding

Feel free to collaborate and contribute to the project!
