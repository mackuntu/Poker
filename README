### Key Components

- **Game Engine** (`Engine/Poker.java`): Main game loop and UI integration
- **Game Logic** (`game/`):
  - `PokerGame`: Core game rules and state management
  - `BettingManager`: Handles betting rounds and pot management
  - `CardManager`: Manages deck and community cards
  - Various managers for player state, dealer position, etc.
- **Player Strategies** (`Player/`):
  - `BasicPokerStrategy`: Standard poker playing logic
  - `AggressiveStrategy`: More aggressive betting patterns
  - `RandomPlayerStrategy`: Random decision making
  - `TestStrategy`: Configurable actions for testing

## Dependencies

- Java 21 or higher
- Processing Core Library
- JUnit 5 (for tests)

## Building and Running

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
./download_deps.sh
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

3. Run the game:

./gradlew run
```

## Game Controls

- Press any key to advance the game
- Press 'R' to restart when game is over

## Game Rules

- Standard Texas Hold'em rules
- Initial stack: $1000 per player
- Starting blinds: $20/$40
- Blinds increase every 10 hands
- Game ends when one player has all the money

## Testing

```bash
./gradlew test
```

The project includes comprehensive tests for:
- Core game mechanics
- Hand evaluation
- Betting logic
- Player actions
- UI components

## Architecture

The game follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Game Logic**
   - State management through specialized managers
   - Clear interfaces for game components
   - Encapsulated betting and pot management

2. **Player Management**
   - Flexible player strategy system
   - State tracking for active/folded/all-in players
   - Support for AI and human players

3. **UI Layer**
   - Processing-based visualization
   - Real-time game state display
   - Hand analysis and action history
